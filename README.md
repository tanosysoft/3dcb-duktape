PS2 3D Rotating Cube with a Custom Texture Demo.

From an ancient PS2SDK demo (https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk/tree/master/ee/draw/samples/texture), I've learned some tweaks about BMP structure, RGB/BGR color space, RAW format, 3D camera zooming and changed its source code a little, and developed a simple tool called bmp2raw.
Well, I'm sharing here, in case some of you want to learn about it, put your own BMP file, play with its source code, camera zoom settings, etc.
